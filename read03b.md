[**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) allows you to create great-looking web pages. [***CSS***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users, how they are styled, laid out, ***etc***.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language â€” [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as ***SVG*** or ***XML***.

 [***CSS***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS) presenting a document to a user which means converting it into a form usable by the audience.

 There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* **External CSS:**

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each **HTML** page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the ***<link>*** element, inside the head section.

* **Internal CSS**

An internal style sheet may be used if one single **HTML** page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the ***<style>*** element, inside the head section.

* **Inline CSS**

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any **CSS** property.
