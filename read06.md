# Definition of function in Javascript:

- [**Functions**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

# Why we use functions?

1. **Organizing our code and make it more readable.**

2. **For reusability.**
