# What are [operators & expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators):

Expressions perform specific actions, based on an operator, with one or two operands. An **operand** can be a constant, a variable or a function result. **Operators** are arithmetic, logical, and relational. As with C, some operators vary in functionality according to the data type of the operands specified in the ***expression***.

# Types of operators:

* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

# Loops in Javascript?

Loops are used in **JavaScript** to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return **true** or **false** when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns ***false***.
