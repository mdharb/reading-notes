Growth mindset is having the mentality of accepting the idea of getting a harsh road full of challenges, and obstacles for the sake of learning an self developing insted of living in the pain of stagnation and self-blaming. Having a growth mindset gives you an advantage to be more self-confident about your ability, and the ability of human's brain of thinking in different ways. Subsequantly knowing that finding a solution for every problem or issue that you face in your daily life is only a matter of time and effort that you must be made. 
without growth mindset people we might be still in the woods till this day, they are mading our life more sustainable and liveable day after day by their developement.
