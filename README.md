# Reading Notes

This website is about adding the **reading** _exercises_, _headlines_ and _notes_ that we are taking during our way to be **software developers**. The purpose behind these reading notes is collecting them in one place to make them easier to be accessed. This course is presenting by [ASAC](https://asac.ltuc.com/) in collaboration with [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/).
