# **HTML**

#### [**Links:**]() Allow you to move from one web page to another, enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing. For that reason they call it the defining feature of the web.

## **Why links are important?**
Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for [links](). Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give them a more positive impression of your site and may encourage them to visit it for longer.

## **Types of URLs**:
1. **Absloute URL:** _When you link to a different website._
2. **Relative URL:** _When linking to other pages within the same site._

# **CSS**

## **Concepts in Positioning Elements:**

#### **Building Blocks:**
1. ***Block-level elements:*** _start on a new line._
2. ***Inline elements flow:*** _in between surrounding text._

#### **Containing Elements:** 
> If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

## **Controlling the Position of Elements.**
* Normal flow.
* Relative Positioning.
* Absolute positioning.

### **Functions:** 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### **VARIABLE SCOPE** 
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function.
