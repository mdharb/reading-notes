# **CSS**

### **Building Blocks**

> CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a **`block-levelbox`** or an **`inline box`**.

* ***Block-level elements***: start on a new line.
* ***Inline elements***: flow in between surrounding text.

### **Controlling the Position of Elements:**

* `Normal flow.`
* `Relative Positioning.`
* `Absolute positioning.`
* `Fixed Positioning.`
* `Floating Elements.`
* `Overlapping Elements.`**(z-index)**

**Screen Sizes:**

> Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

**Screen Resolution:**

> Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

**Page Sizes:**

> Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000. pixels wide


### **`Fixed Width Layouts:`**

* Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in **pixels**.

### **`Liquid Layouts:`**

* Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use **percentages**

## **CSS Frameworks**

* CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
