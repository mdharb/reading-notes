# **Build the Perfect Team**

> To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize **team-focused learning**.

* **THE WORK ISSUE:**
  - How to Build a Perfect Team.
  - The War on Meetings.
  - The Case for Blind Hiring.
  - Failure to Lunch.
  - The 'Good Jobs' Gamble.
  - Rethinking the Work-Life Equation.
  - The Rise of White-Collar Automation.
  - The Post-Cubicle Office.
  - The New Dream Jobs.

* **employee performance optimization:** analyzing and improving individual workers a practice which is **not enough** to build a perfect team. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based.

* In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

* **Google** top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together’’. ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’

* **Group norms.’’** Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound.

* Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

* After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

* **Two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:**
  1. A team which everyone is **spoken roughly the same amount.** ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’
   * ‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ - ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’

  2. A team had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.


  ####  Research on **psychological safety** pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that **psychological safety**, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.

  # **Conclution:**

  * **PSYCOLOGICAL SAFTEY** is the most important factor in perfect team. Where you are able to share thoughts and ideas without being scared of judgements by others.
