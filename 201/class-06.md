# **Problem Domain**

### **hardest thing about writing code?**

* Learning a new technology.
* Naming things.
* Testing your code.
* Debugging.
* Fixing bugs.
* Making software maintainable.

> But as I reflect back on my programming career, and I’ve conversed with many new programmers that are learning the craft, I’ve found the single hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain. " John Sonmez"

### **Protein Tracker:**
* application is that it allows a user to set a goal for the amount of protein to consume in a day.  The user can add protein amounts which are added to a total protein count that is tracked for that user.

>  understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation. It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question. It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions. " John Sonmez"

### **What is an Object?**

* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names.
  - Variables become known as ***PROPERTIES.*** 
  - Functions become known as ***METHODS.***

### **Creating new object:**
* Literal Notiation:
Is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.

### **Document Object Model (DOM)**
* Specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of web page while it is in the browser window. 

* The **DOM** is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules. It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas: 
   - Making a model of the HTML page.
   - Accessing and changing the HTML page.

> You will hear people call the DOM an **Application Programming Interface (API)**. User interfaces let humans interact with programs; **APls** let programs (and scripts) talk to each other. The DOM states what your script can "ask the browser about the current page, and how to tell the browser to update what is being shown to the user.  

### **DOM Tree:**

* As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes:

  - **The document Node.**
  - **Element Node.**
  - **Attribute Node.**
  - **Text Node.**

### **DOM Queires:**
* Methods that find elements in DOM tree called DOM queires. Uses when you want to work on element repeatdly.

> **DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.**

* **Methods to select individual elements:**
    - getElementById().
    - querySelector().
* **Methods to select element from nodelist:**
    - item().
    - getElementsByClassName().

* **Adding or remove HTML content methods:**
    - The ***innerHTML*** property.
    - ***DOM*** manipulation.
