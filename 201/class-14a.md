# **CSS**

### **[Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)**

* With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the **transform property**.


* **Transform Property Settings:**
   1. Two-dimensional: _work on the x and y axes_
   2. Three-dimensional: _work on the x, y axes, and z axis_

### **[Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)** 

* With CSS3 **transitions** you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

* **Animations** within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

#### **Transitions:**

* The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target` **pseudo-classes**. 

* **Transition properties**
  - **Transition-property:** _property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties._
  - **Transition-duration:** _The duration in which a transition takes place_
  - **Transition-timing-function:** _used to set the speed in which a transition will move._
  - **Transition-delay:** _The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing._

#### **Animations**

* Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.
