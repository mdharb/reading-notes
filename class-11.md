# **CSS**

## **Images**

* You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

* Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the 
images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

* You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages.

* Whenever you use consistently sized images across a site, you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the dimensions in the HTML.

* Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a ***rollover***) and a third style when they click on it. 

* When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a ***sprite***. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image.

### **Contrast of background images:**

* **Types of Contrast:**
  - High Contrast:
    - _A high contrast background image makes the text difficult to read._
  - Low Contrast:
    - _A low contrast background image makes the text easier to read._
  - Screen:
    - _A screen added to a high contrast image makes the text easier to read._

### **SEO TECHNIQUES**

***On Page Techniques:*** 

* On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.

* The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.

* Ensuring that any images have appropriate text in the value of their **alt attribute** also helps search engines understand the content of images.

* Search engines rely very heavily on the text that is in your pages so it is important that the terms people are going to search for are in **text**. ***There are seven essential places where you want your keywords to appear,which are mentioned below***:
  1. Page Title.
  2. URL / Web Address.
  3. Headings.
  4. Text.
  5. Link Text.
  6. Image Alt Text.
  7. Page Descriptions.


***Off Page Techniques:***

* Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to **rank** your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. They are particularly interested 
in sites whose content is related to yours.

* Search engines also look at the words between the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered more relevant.

* The words that appear in links to your site should also appear in the text of the page that the site links to.
