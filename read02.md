## [Version control](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#2):
Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

## History of version control:
- [Local Version Control](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#2_1)
- [Centralized Version Control](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#2_2)
- [Distributed Version Control](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#2_3)

## What is Git?

**Git** is a [DVCS](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#2_3) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project **-called commit-** *Git* creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by **Git**. And, as the gatekeeper, **Git** will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

**Git** is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
