# **REST**

## **How I explained REST to my brother**

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
   * A smart guy helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the interne, and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

2. **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
   * Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
   * is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. **What does a `GET` do?**
   * systems retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET.

5. **What does a `POST` do?**
   * When one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

6. **What does a `PUT` do?**
   * If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

7. **What does a `PATCH` do?**
   *  If a system wants to do a partial update, it'll use PATCH.
