# **Introduction to React and Components.**

## **Components:**

* A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. Also it could be defined as a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.

## **Views of a Component:**

* Object-oriented view.
* Conventional view.
* Process-related view.

## **Charactistics of a component:**

* Reusability.
* Replaceable.
* Not context specific.
* Extensible.
* Encapsulated.
* Independent.

## **Advantages of using component based architecture:**

* Ease of deployment.
* Reduced cost.
* Ease of development.
* Reusable.
* Modification of technical complexity.
* System maintenance and evolution.

## **Props:**

* **Props** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

* **React is a component-based library** which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using ***props***.

## **Using Props in React:**

1. Define an attribute and its value(data).
2. Pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
3. Render the Props Data.

## **The flow of props:**

* Props data is **read-only**, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
