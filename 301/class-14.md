# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

***

1. **What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**
   * The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
   * Because families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers. This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies

***

1. **What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**
   * All of tech companies are having a higher percantage of male employment than female.
   * Even if they are around 6% of US population, Asian are taking a high percantage of employment rate in top rated tech companies.
   *  In the top 50 tech companies, around 80% of the employees are white, which means there is an issue in distributing the man power.

##  Why diversity matters to your tech company

***

1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?**
   * Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?**
   * Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it. On the other hand diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.

3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
   * When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. For example: 
        * YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
        * If more black people were building features or striking partnerships at Twitter, perhaps they’d have a great idea" for more effectively engaging black users.
