## Pair Programming

***

* **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**
  1. Greater efficiency.
  2. Engaged collaboration.
  3. Learning from fellow students.
  4. Social skills.
  5. Job interview readiness.
  6. Work environment readiness.

* **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
   * I think for me the social skills improvement is the most beneficial reason for pair programing. Specially since we are getting our course from home virtually it helps in connecting between fellow developers. On the other hand it gives you an indication about the work environment which is something really important when it comes to pair programming.

* **How does pair programming work?**
  * pair programming involves two roles:
    1. Driver: is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
    2. Navigator: uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
